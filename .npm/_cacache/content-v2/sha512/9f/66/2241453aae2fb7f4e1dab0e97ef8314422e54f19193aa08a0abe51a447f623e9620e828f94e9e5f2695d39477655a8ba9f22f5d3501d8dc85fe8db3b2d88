However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only\n      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf\n      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,\n      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability\n      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason\n      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.\n\n   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n   APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.\n\n      To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following\n      boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets \"{}\"\n      replaced with your own identifying information.

The contents\n          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and\n          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution\n          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside\n          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided\n          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed\n          as modifying the License.\n\n      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and\n      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions\n      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or\n      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,\n      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with\n      the conditions stated in this License.\n\n   5.

Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing\n      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,\n      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,\n      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this\n      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only\n      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf\n      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,\n      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability\n      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason\n      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.\n\n   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n   APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.\n\n      To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following\n      boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets \"{}\"\n      replaced with your own identifying information.

What is it?\n\nAn easy-to-use stream-based toolkit that you can use for media processing. All the features provided have predictable\nabstractions and join together coherently.\n\n```js\n// This example will demux and decode an Opus-containing OGG file, and then write it to a file.\nconst prism = require('prism-media');\nconst fs = require('fs');\n\nfs.createReadStream('./audio.ogg')\n  .pipe(new prism.opus.OggDemuxer())\n  .pipe(new prism.opus.Decoder({ rate: 48000, channels: 2, frameSize: 960 }))\n  .pipe(fs.createWriteStream('./audio.pcm'));\n```\n\nThe example above can work with either a native or pure JavaScript Opus decoder - you don't need to worry about changing\nyour code for whichever you install.\n\n- FFmpeg support (either through npm modules or a normal installation) \n- Opus support (native or pure JavaScript)\n- Demuxing for WebM/OGG files (no modules required!)\n- Volume Altering (no modules required!)\n\n## Dependencies\n\nThe following dependencies are all optional, and you should only install one from each category (the first listed in\neach category is preferred)\n\n- Opus\n  - [`@discordjs/opus`](https://github.com/discordjs/opus)\n  - [`node-opus`](https://github.com/Rantanen/node-opus)\n  - [`opusscript`](https://github.com/abalabahaha/opusscript)\n- FFmpeg\n  - [`ffmpeg-static`](http://npmjs.com/ffmpeg-static)\n  - `ffmpeg` from a [normal installation](https://www.ffmpeg.org/download.html)\n- CRC\n  - [`node-crc`](https://github.com/magiclen/node-crc)\n\n## Useful Links\n\n- [Documentation](https://hydrabolt.me/prism-media)\n- [Examples](https://github.com/amishshah/prism-media/tree/master/examples)\n- [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/discordjs)\n\n## License\n\n> Copyright 2019 - 2020 Amish Shah\n> \n> Licensed under the

What is it?\n\nAn easy-to-use stream-based toolkit that you can use for media processing. All the features provided have predictable\nabstractions and join together coherently.\n\n```js\n// This example will demux and decode an Opus-containing OGG file, and then write it to a file.\nconst prism = require('prism-media');\nconst fs = require('fs');\n\nfs.createReadStream('./audio.ogg')\n  .pipe(new prism.opus.OggDemuxer())\n  .pipe(new prism.opus.Decoder({ rate: 48000, channels: 2, frameSize: 960 }))\n  .pipe(fs.createWriteStream('./audio.pcm'));\n```\n\nThe example above can work with either a native or pure JavaScript Opus decoder - you don't need to worry about changing\nyour code for whichever you install.\n\n- FFmpeg support (either through npm modules or a normal installation) \n- Opus support (native or pure JavaScript)\n- Demuxing for WebM/OGG files (no modules required!)\n- Volume Altering (no modules required!)\n\n## Dependencies\n\nThe following dependencies are all optional, and you should only install one from each category (the first listed in\neach category is preferred)\n\n- Opus\n  - [`@discordjs/opus`](https://github.com/discordjs/opus)\n  - [`node-opus`](https://github.com/Rantanen/node-opus)\n  - [`opusscript`](https://github.com/abalabahaha/opusscript)\n- FFmpeg\n  - [`ffmpeg-static`](http://npmjs.com/ffmpeg-static)\n  - `ffmpeg` from a [normal installation](https://www.ffmpeg.org/download.html)\n\n## Useful Links\n\n- [Documentation](https://amishshah.github.io/prism-media)\n- [Examples](https://github.com/amishshah/prism-media/tree/master/examples)\n- [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/discordjs)\n\n## License\n\n> Copyright 2019 - 2022 Amish Shah\n> \n> Licensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (the \"License\");\n> you may not use this file except in compliance with the License.\n> You may obtain a copy of the License at\n> \n>    http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0\n> \n> Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, software\n> distributed under the License is distributed on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\n> WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied.\n> See the License for the specific language governing permissions and\n> limitations under the License.","maintainers":[{"name":"hydrabolt","email":"amish@shah.gg"}],"time":{"modified":"2023-02-27T15:59:03.719Z","created":"2017-04-15T18:32:51.307Z","0.0.1":"2017-04-15T18:32:51.307Z","0.0.2":"2017-10-22T14:44:12.728Z","0.1.0":"2018-01-21T17:42:21.553Z","0.2.0":"2018-03-05T19:28:52.683Z","0.2.1":"2018-03-30T14:08:33.189Z","0.3.0":"2018-06-20T19:41:33.104Z","0.3.1":"2018-06-22T18:09:00.914Z","0.0.3":"2018-08-07T19:29:43.456Z","0.4.0":"2019-02-17T20:36:07.236Z","0.4.1":"2019-02-17T20:38:43.304Z","0.4.2":"2019-02-17T21:45:55.807Z","1.0.0":"2019-02-21T11:50:04.343Z","1.0.1":"2019-02-22T14:59:04.171Z","1.0.2":"2019-04-28T16:34:06.789Z","1.1.0":"2019-08-22T11:38:22.431Z","1.2.0":"2020-01-16T11:11:46.805Z","0.0.4":"2020-01-16T11:50:35.027Z","1.2.1":"2020-02-26T13:40:00.837Z","1.2.2":"2020-05-02T11:28:00.781Z","1.2.3":"2020-12-02T22:10:29.697Z","1.2.4":"2021-02-03T18:25:47.402Z","1.2.5":"2021-02-03T19:34:26.390Z","1.2.6":"2021-02-13T17:40:14.858Z","1.2.7":"2021-02-17T09:53:24.430Z","1.2.8":"2021-03-13T12:56:35.491Z","1.2.9":"2021-03-20T17:16:36.106Z","1.3.0":"2021-06-12T10:28:53.661Z","1.3.1":"2021-06-12T10:38:44.896Z","2.0.0-alpha.0":"2021-08-09T09:51:36.213Z","1.3.2":"2021-08-09T19:23:06.383Z","1.3.4":"2022-07-09T11:03:35.428Z","1.3.5":"2023-02-27T15:59:03.606Z"},"homepage":"https://github.com/hydrabolt/prism-media#readme","keywords":["audio","media","ffmpeg","opus","pcm","webm","ogg"],"repository":{"type":"git","url":"git+https://github.com/hydrabolt/prism-media.git"},"author":{"name":"Amish Shah","email":"amish@shah.gg"},"bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/hydrabolt/prism-media/issues"},"license":"Apache-2.0","readmeFilename":"README.md","users":{"hintss":true}}
